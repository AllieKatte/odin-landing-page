## ✎⋆.ೃ࿔\*:･ *Odin Landing Page* ࿐ ࿔\*:･ﾟ

This is my second project for The Odin Project Foundations module!

During this project I practiced using CSS and Flexbox to create a page design based on a reference image, and I really focused on trying to minimize the amount of duplicated CSS as much as I could.

I had a lot of fun doing this project! It took me quite a while due to being busy with real life, but I really enjoyed trying to match up my own page to the reference design as closely as I could. Sometimes some of the adjustments got a little frustrating, but when I figured out how to make the CSS do what I wanted it felt really good! I'm sure it's not very impressive compared to professional web pages, but I'm really proud of how it came out! 🥰
